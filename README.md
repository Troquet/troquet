### Hello My name is Taylor Roquet

- I am currently a memeber of the OpenUAS undergrad team at Iowa State. I enjoy working on the project quite a bit. This past year was the first successful flight for the team and we are hopeful for a the success of this semester's iteration of the design. 
- My goals for the 2021-2022 school year is to improve my overall programming skils. I am familiar with MATLAB Programming but not as much with python, any version of C, or java. My method of improving will be to create a library in each of the programs by coding the problems in my text books from eah of my classes this year.  
- I am a memeber of the SOFIRST club at Iowa State Univerity. A club that's goal to help increase the number of alummni volunteers for FIRST robotics events across the state of Iowa. Feel free to ask me about any information about the FIRST program or the SOFIRST club at Iowa State Univeristy. Also we are looking for any volunteers to help out not just alumni members.
